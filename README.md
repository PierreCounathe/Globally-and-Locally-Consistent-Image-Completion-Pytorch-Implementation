# Globally-and-Locally-Consistent-Image-Completion-Pytorch-Implementation
Implementation of the Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion paper (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3072959.3073659) in Pytorch, on the CelebA Dataset

## Project Decomposition

This project has four main components: 3 .py files and an .ipynb notebook file:
- 'models.py' contains two classes defining the completion and discrimination networks;
- 'utils.py' contains all the side functions that we needed to perform various tasks;
- 'trainers.py' contains the implementation of the three training algorithms used to train the GAN;
- 'train_and_assess.ipynb' is the notebook where all these previous functions and classess are used in order to create a GAN, train it, and assess its performances. For convenience purpose, and to make the project interactive and playful we chose to keep this step in a notebook.
